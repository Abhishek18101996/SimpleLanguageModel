# SimpleLanguageModel

Data preparation
The first section of the notebook prepares the data for training the RNN. The data consists of a set of addition problems, each of which is represented as a pair of numbers. The numbers are encoded as one-hot vectors, and the addition problems are encoded as sequences of one-hot vectors.

Model training
The second section of the notebook trains the RNN. The RNN is a simple RNN with one hidden layer. The RNN is trained using the backpropagation algorithm.

Model evaluation
The third section of the notebook evaluates the trained RNN. The RNN is evaluated by feeding it a set of unseen addition problems. The RNN's predictions are compared to the ground truth answers.

The notebook shows that it is possible to use an RNN to solve the addition problem. The RNN is able to learn the addition rule from a set of training examples. The RNN is then able to use the learned rule to solve unseen addition problems.

Here are some additional details about the notebook:

The notebook uses the Keras library to implement the RNN.
The notebook uses the Adam optimizer to train the RNN.
The notebook uses the mean squared error loss function to evaluate the RNN.
The notebook uses the accuracy metric to evaluate the RNN.
The notebook is a good example of how to use an RNN to solve a simple problem. The notebook is also a good example of how to use the Keras library.
